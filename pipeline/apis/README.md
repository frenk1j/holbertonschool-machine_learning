# Data Collection - APIs  
**Holberton School Machine Learning Track**

This project focuses on collecting, processing, and transforming data from external APIs.  
Data ingestion is a fundamental component in building data pipelines and ML systems.  
Here we use multiple APIs (SWAPI, GitHub API, SpaceX API) to practice pagination, rate limits, JSON handling, and data manipulation.
