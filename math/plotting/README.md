# Project: Data Visualization with Matplotlib

## Overview

This project is designed to introduce and improve your skills in visualizing data using Python’s `matplotlib` library. By completing the tasks, you will learn how to create various types of plots (line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and bar graphs), how to customize them, and how to properly scale and label axes for better data presentation.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What is a plot?
- What is a scatter plot? Line graph? Bar graph? Histogram?
- What is `matplotlib`?
- How to plot data with `matplotlib`
- How to label a plot
- How to scale an axis
- How to plot multiple sets of data at the same time

---

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** using `python3` (version 3.9)
- Your files will be executed with `numpy` (version 1.25.2) and `matplotlib` (version 3.8.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.11.1)
- All your modules should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have documentation (e.g., `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Unless otherwise noted, you are not allowed to import any module
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
