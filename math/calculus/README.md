## üßÆ Key Concepts

### ‚ûï Summations
Implemented using sigma notation and Python functions:
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2
\]

### ‚úñÔ∏è Products
Explores pi notation:
\[
\prod_{i=1}^{m} i = m!
\]

### üß† Derivatives
Covers differentiation rules:
- Power rule
- Product rule
- Logarithmic differentiation
- Partial derivatives

### ‚à´ Integrals
Introduces:
- Indefinite and definite integrals
- Constant of integration `C`
- Integration of polynomials and exponentials

## ‚öôÔ∏è Example
```python
from math import log

# Example: polynomial derivative
def poly_derivative(poly):
    if not isinstance(poly, list) or len(poly) == 0:
        return None
    if len(poly) == 1:
        return [0]
    return [coef * i for i, coef in enumerate(poly)][1:]

print(poly_derivative([5, 3, 0, 1]))  # [3, 0, 3]
