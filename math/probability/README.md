# Poisson Distribution

## Overview
This project implements a class `Poisson` that represents a **Poisson probability distribution**.  
The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of occurrences of an event within a fixed interval of time or space when the events occur independently and with a known constant mean rate.

- **0-main.py** → Test file used to verify that the class works correctly.
